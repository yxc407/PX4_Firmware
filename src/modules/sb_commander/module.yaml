description:
  short: CLI interface for Switchblade attack commands
  long: |
    This module provides a CLI interface to control the "Switchblade" functionality.
    It parses user commands (`attack_position` with local or global coordinates, 
    `attack_trigger`, and `attack_cancel`) and publishes the corresponding 
    `switchblade_command_s` uORB message. All errors and important information are 
    printed to the console via PX4_WARN/PX4_ERR. The CLI command returns immediately 
    after publishing the message (non-blocking execution).
