environment:
  matrix:
    - TC_CONFIG: tests # this builds posix in tc_sitl_test folder and runs tests
    - TC_CONFIG: tc_fmu-v5_default

install:
# if the toolchain wasn't restored from build cache download and install it

# Note: using Start-Process -Wait is important
# because otherwise the install begins but non-blocking and the result cannot be used just after

build_script:
# FIXME Temporary we need to create the home folder because it's not contained in installer 0.5 and CI fails if it doesn't exist
- if not exist "C:\TC\home" mkdir C:\TC\home
# setup the environmental variables to work within the installed cygwin toolchain
- call C:\TC\toolchain\scripts\setup-environment.bat x
# safe the repopath for switching to it in cygwin bash
- for /f %%i in ('cygpath -u %%CD%%') do set repopath=%%i
# build the make target
- call bash --login -c "cd $repopath && make $TC_CONFIG"

# Note: using bash --login is important
# because otherwise certain things (like python; import numpy) do not work

cache:
# cache the entire toolchain installation folder to avoid
# downloading it from AWS S3 and installing the MSI each time
# it's ~1.8GB > 1GB free limit for build caches
- C:\TC -> appveyor.yml
